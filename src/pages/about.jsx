      <h3>My name is Jake Gulotta</h3>
      <h3>
        I am an aspiring software developer with an interest in things that have
        to do with human thought and it's many misleading intuitions.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        For this reason I've created this website to chronicle all the things
        that I believe to be useful in understanding the limitations of human
        thought.
